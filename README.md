`reactor` is a graphics and compute engine focused in simplicity and learnability, thanks for checking out.

If you want to try the examples, just `git clone --recursive <git url>`, open with premake and run

I hope to have an interesting scene format so examples can be given as scenes or pure code
Anyway the interest of the engine is seamless shader setups (being them either graphics or compute) so you are expected to work with shaders in this engine
This is not a game engine, is a render and is focused in graphics/compute experimentation.
