`reactor`
=========

`reactor` is a graphics and compute engine focused in simplicity and
learnability, thanks for checking out.

Setup
-----
Right now, there is an automated setup for Windows only.
Before installation, be sure to have Visual Studio 2017 and the LunarG Vulkan SDK installed

For building, just follow the steps below:

	git clone git@gitlab.com:0xafbf/reactor.git
	cd reactor
	./setup.ps1 # and build from visual studio
	# or:
	./build.ps1 # to setup and build from the command line

Contributions for setup in other platforms are welcome

The interest of the engine is seamless shader setups (being them either graphics or compute) so you are expected to work with shaders in this engine
This is not a game engine, is a render and is focused in graphics/compute experimentation.
