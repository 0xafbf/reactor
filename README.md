`reactor` is a graphics and compute engine focused in simplicity and
learnability, thanks for checking out.

If you want to try the examples, just `git clone --recursive <git url>`, open
with premake and run

I hope to have an interesting scene format so examples can be given as scenes
or pure code.
Anyway the interest of the engine is seamless shader setups (being them either graphics or compute) so you are expected to work with shaders in this engine
This is not a game engine, is a render and is focused in graphics/compute experimentation. 

For a more in depth explanation of the intention behind `reactor`, please go to
the wiki https://github.com/0xafbf/reactor/wiki/About

I follow development at https://twitch.tv/0xAFBF

I do the streams in spanish as it is fewer the people who actually talk about things like this in spanish. Nevertheless feel free to come by and ask any question or join the conversation.
